= Introduction =

The TorAS source code attempts to be ad autonomous and behind-the-scenes as possible, reducing the dependence on the developer to create complex setups and connections using the Tor services.

For this reason, TorAS comes with a number of default settings and pre-configurations intended to start the services automatically. While this will probably be sufficient for most developers, at least initially, it's wortwhile to become familiar with the rudimentary operation of TorAS.

It is assumed that developers using TorAS have some knowledge with ActionScript (creating class instances, calling methods, working with data, etc.)

Additionally, while TorAS provides a simplified way to access the Tor services, developers should refer to the Tor Protocol Specification for a complete and authoritative source of information:
